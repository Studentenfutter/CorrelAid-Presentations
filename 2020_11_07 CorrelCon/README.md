# CorrelAid (LC) Animated Background

For a small presentation of our Local Chapter Cologne I created an animated bakground slide with R, ioslides and [particle.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/).
Included are both versions with the CorrelAid [Main](https://github.com/Studentenfutter/CorrelAid-Presentations/2020_11_07%20CorrelCon/particlesjs-config.json)
and [Local Chapter](https://github.com/Studentenfutter/CorrelAid-Presentations/2020_11_07%20CorrelCon/particlesjs-config-localchapter.json)-Colors as specified in the [Design Guide](https://docs.correlaid.org/wiki/design-guide#color-concepts).

Feel free to use this as a background for your own (virtual) meetups and presentations!
